Hello, I'm Josh. I help create software as a hands-on programmer and engineering leader. I'm based in not-very-sunny[^mcr] Manchester, UK.

{{< titleWithEmoji "Now" "👨‍💻">}}

Right now, I'm doing contract work via my luxury engineering consulting vehicle, [Pretty Good Software](https://pg.software). If you'd like to work together, do reach out[^availability].

{{< titleWithEmoji "Previously" "📆">}}

My most recent full-time role was as Chief Technology Officer at [Contact](https://contact.xyz). I built their software and technology team from the ground up.

I also looked after iOS engineering at [Poolsuite](https://poolsuite.net), a summer-themed music platform. The app I built for them single-handedly[^poolsuite] was an [Apple Design Award](https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/) finalist in 2021.

Prior to that, I helped build software for [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk), [Beano](https://beano.com)[^beano], the [Government Digital Service](https://gov.uk), [Wonderbly](https://wonderbly.com), [Daisie](https://daisie.com), [Banked](https://banked.com), [Bricklane](https://bricklane.com) and the [BBC](https://bbc.co.uk), amongst many others[^otherwork].

You can get in touch with me via email – I'm [josh@joshmcmillan.com](mailto:josh@joshmcmillan.com) – or you can send me a DM on Twitter, where I'm [@jshmc](https://twitter.com/jshmc).

[^mcr]: It has [a lot of rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester#Climate). Maybe that's the reason that [Oasis](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_(band)>)'s music isn't very good.
[^availability]: I'm currently only available for freelance work on a part-time basis – I have two days per week to spare. I'd really like to work on projects that actively improve people's lives – tools that help them overcome a struggle via technology. I'm also interested in projects that involve audio, music and radio. I don't find crypto or web3 particularly exciting, unless it's attached to a product with a meaningful vision and a plan to neutralise its carbon impact.
[^poolsuite]: While I did all of the engineering on the Poolsuite app, its success is in no small part due to [Marty](https://twitter.com/marty)'s vision and [Niek](https://twitter.com/niekdekker)'s design. The engineering's really kick-ass though.
[^beano]: The [British comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beano), not the [American flatulence reliever](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beano_(dietary_supplement)>). Look, it's come up enough times to justify it in a footnote here, okay?
[^otherwork]: You can see all the folks I've worked for on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jshmc/).
