Hello, I'm Josh. I help create software as a hands-on programmer and engineering leader.

I'm currently finishing up as Chief Technology Officer at [Contact](https://contact.xyz), a platform for booking creatives. I'll be available for **new work** from **December 2021**.

In my spare time, I look after iOS at [Poolside FM](https://poolside.fm), a summer-themed music platform.

In the past, I've helped build software for [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk), [The Beano](https://beano.com), the [Government Digital Service](https://gov.uk), [Wonderbly](https://wonderbly.com), [Daisie](https://daisie.com), [Banked](https://banked.com), [Bricklane](https://bricklane.com) and the [BBC](https://bbc.co.uk), amongst many others.
