Hello, I'm Josh. I help create software as a hands-on programmer and engineering leader.

{{< titleWithEmoji "Now" "👨‍💻">}}

Right now, I'm doing contract work via my luxury engineering consulting vehicle, [Pretty Good Software](https://pg.software). If you'd like to work together, do reach out.

In my spare time, I look after iOS at [Poolsuite](https://poolsuite.net), a summer-themed music platform. The app I built for them was an Apple Design Award finalist in 2021.

My most recent full-time role was as Chief Technology Officer at [Contact](https://contact.xyz). I built their software and technology team from the ground up.

Prior to that, I helped build software for [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk), [The Beano](https://beano.com), the [Government Digital Service](https://gov.uk), [Wonderbly](https://wonderbly.com), [Daisie](https://daisie.com), [Banked](https://banked.com), [Bricklane](https://bricklane.com) and the [BBC](https://bbc.co.uk), amongst many others.
