Hello, I'm Josh. I help create software as a hands-on programmer and engineering leader.

{{< titleWithEmoji "Now" "👨‍💻">}}

By day, I'm Chief Technology Officer at [Contact](https://contact.xyz), a platform for booking creatives.

In my spare time, I look after iOS at [Poolside FM](https://poolside.fm), a summer-themed music platform.

In the past, I've helped build software for [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk), [The Beano](https://beano.com), the [Government Digital Service](https://gov.uk), [Wonderbly](https://wonderbly.com), [Daisie](https://daisie.com), [Banked](https://banked.com), [Bricklane](https://bricklane.com) and the [BBC](https://bbc.co.uk), amongst many others.

You can get in touch with me via email – I'm [josh@joshmcmillan.com](mailto:josh@joshmcmillan.com).

I'm not currently interested in new work – I really like my job. Please don't contact me about that kind of thing, particularly if you're a recruiter.
