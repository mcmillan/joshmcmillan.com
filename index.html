      Right, that's enough of the third person. Pleasure to meet you, I'm Josh.
    </p>

    <p class="measure-wide f3 lh-copy mv3">
      I make software (websites, apps, prototypes, backend stuff to keep
      businesses afloat, infrastructure, etc) for startups, established
      companies, governments, and just about everyone in between. I do so using
      whatever's the right tool for the job – Ruby or Scala, Kotlin or Swift,
      AWS or Heroku – you get the idea.
    </p>

    <p class="measure-wide f3 lh-copy mv3">
      In addition to just writing code, I've got a bunch of experience leading
      teams and helping define and ship products. Software engineering in
      isolation never works, and working on a product from definition to
      execution is something I really enjoy (and hopefully am fairly good at).

    <p class="measure-wide f3 lh-copy mt3 mb1">
      I've been doing this for a long time, and it seems customary for people to
      list who they've worked with on their websites, so here's a brief list of
      folks I've helped out the past:
