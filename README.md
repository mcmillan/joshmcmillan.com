This is my personal website. It doesn't have much of interest on it.

It's built using [Hugo](https://hugo.io/), and leverages its functionality wherever possible.

## Development

1. Install [Hugo](https://hugo.io) (`brew install hugo`)
1. Clone this repository
1. Run `hugo server`

This should expose a dev server at `localhost:1313`.

## Deployment

Pushing to the `main` branch of this repository will trigger a build on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
