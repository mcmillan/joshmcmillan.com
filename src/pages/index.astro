      I like making software that people love to use, either as an individual
      contributor or leader. I try not to tie myself to any one technology or
      stack, but these days I really like working with Rails, React, Swift and
      Elixir.

      I work at <a href="https://tuple.app" class="text-indigo-600">Tuple</a>,
      where I look after backend and web engineering.
